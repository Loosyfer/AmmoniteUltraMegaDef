  moduleDetails:
  - "If a creature has less than 500HP, you can execute it, but will be utterly disintegrated
    and you won\u2019t be able to harvest it for any organic effects or modules.
    Charges up after 5 battles. If operated by a General Officer, it can be executed
    at 700 HP."
  - Twice per battle, you can select a module from your ship, destroy it and turn
    into a Modublast Bomb that will deal 400 dmg to the enemy.
  - For each crew member that died, this module has 1 Soul Bullet. Once per battle,
    shoot a Soul Bullet that will deal 600 dmg to the enemy. The Soul Bullet will
    carry the name of the deceased owner of the soul.
  - Fuse two crew members into one mega crew member of 100% performance, extra HP
    and high level, and having both professions and both their first Traits. Takes
    5 battles to recharge.
  - "Cryo-preserve a crew member when they die. If you have 2 Doctors adjacent to
    this capsule, you can bring this person back to life. Takes 5 battles to fully
    charge. Flooding will disable this module\u2019s effect."
  - Once per battle, during your turn, you can pause time and rearrange your modules,
    except for this one.
  - The crew member in this module will take damage instead of the ship, losing 1
    HP for every 200 Ship HP lost.
  - All of your other modules except for this one are rerolled into random ones until
    the end of the fight. If you lose the battle, all your original modules return
    and you can continue with battle with the same amount of Ship HP you started
    with.
  - "Cannot place a crew member in it. At the beginning of the fight, the portal
    will open, to reveal the otherworldly return of the first Crew Member that ever
    died this Dive, exactly as you remembered him, except that he will have an HP
    bar of 12 Points, and will always take aggro from the monster for as long as
    he\u2019s alive."
  - Every other module in the ship will work even if unmanned. Charges up in 4 battles.
  - "It will take 15 turns to create a clone of a crew member that\u2019s in it.
    If the module is disturbed during the cloning process, the resulting clone will
    be a random abomination."
  - This module counts as 4 Defensive modules for all effects and purposes. Only
    once per Dive, duplicate your Ship HP, and any amount above your original Ship
    HP will stay as a shield into future battles.
  - Summon an Abyssal Beast that will fight by your side during this battle. Takes
    4 battles to recharge.
  - If you kill a creature, the squid capsule redirects his life energy into the
    crew, healing by 1HP every crew member.
