  flavour:
  - Little Sluugi is trapped in a bottle that serves as a defensive carapace, without
    which Sluugi will tremble and panic.
  - "Cute baby shark that munches at the ship because it thinks it\u2019s food. It
    boasts a surprising amount of strength for its tiny size, which is a warning
    for how powerful the adults will be."
  - Fat greedy  leech that sucks vitality from its prey.
  - Insecure about its own carapace, it hides in its shell most of the time. If exposed,
    it tries to look cute in the hopes that it will save its life.
  - Ancient critter that has survived eons of natural selection, but might not survive
    a blast to its face.
  - Crafty being that stores urchins inside its shell and shoots them like bullets
    into unsuspecting enemies.

    form and movement of nearby crabs to free itself in search of food.
  - "A noble creature that guards the entrance to the depths of the sea from intruders
    that haven\u2019t proved worthy to access its secrets."

    and it can\u2019t find a mate because it pokes surrounding fish to death."
  - Basic and common good old ammonite.
  - These tapeworms were too weak to infect a creature individually, so instead they
    formed a menacing ball.

    state.

    is here in all its glory and mysteriousness.
  - Ancient sea lizard with enormous eyes that can see very far through the depths
    of the sea.
  - "This creature seems to have one same orifice for eating and excreting. It\u2019s
    so inflated it looks like it could explode at any moment."
  - Mysterious starfish that uses psychic powers to confuse its enemy.
  - This elegant fish appears during the day, and shines like the sun. At dusk, they
    look for Moonfish to mate with.
  - This elegant fish appears at night, and shines like moonlight. At dusk, they
    look for Sunfish to mate with.
  - Gigantic sea bug with a very hard shell, curled up in a ball. After the shell

    enemies, and uses both offensive and defensive techniques in battle.

  - Mr. Kamura was a strange man from Ammonite Town. It was known that he was obsessed

    wished he was born at sea. He disappeared 10 years ago, and most assumed he just
    drowned while cherishing the ocean.
  - His owner must have discarded him because he was too much work to take care of.
    The ape has somehow survived and adapted to his new life, using his long arms
    to claw at prey foolish enough to laugh at him being trapped in a cage.

    its bite is so strong that if it misses, he\u2019ll shatter its own bones and
    get a horrible headache."

    face.

    it, now using it as a daunting weapon to dominate its environment.
  - "A whale so massive that it can\u2019t change direction or stop moving, it just
    charges forward destroying or eating any obstacles in its path."
  - Its rotting flesh is somehow being kept alive, and the corpse is enjoying its
    newfound life.

  - "Crazy monster with explosives at the end of its tail. It won\u2019t hesitate
    to use its tail even at the cost of its own flesh."
  - A turtle so gigantic that it has grown its own ecosystem. It is unknown if the
    turtle is alive or if the ecosystem continues on a dead shell.
  - "This creature might miss its chomps every now and again, but when they land

    before consuming them.
  - This ferocious angry narwhal might be too reckless for its own good.
  - A smart lobster that enjoys taunting its enemies while they freeze to death.
  - This octopus has a brain that never stopped growing. After centuries, it became
    so big and powerful that it learned to subdue other creatures with mentally-charged
    electric blasts.
  - This colossal polar bear became too heavy to live on the surface, and thus delved
    into the ocean, where it transformed into an even bigger monstrosity.
  - "Mysterious squid that doesn\u2019t look like it belongs to this world. Whoever
    is captivated by the curves of the squid for too long will be hypnotised and
    have their whole life elapse within minutes."
  - "The crew from this ship didn\u2019t die when it sank. Now, they roam the abyss

    them.
  - This abomination lures other creatures with its own head and claims their life
    force to maintain its dead corpse.
  - This monster uses its light to lure its prey into his mouth. However, it has
    also grown limbs to chase bigger prey through the bottom of the sea.
  - This majestic beast overflies and watches the rifts of the ocean, as it chooses
    which bottom creature will be sacrificed next.
  - Flushed down the toilet by its owner decades ago, this only made it stronger.
    Its sole purpose is to exact revenge upon its owner, and it looks like it found
    him in your crew.
  - A witch from centuries ago. In search of more power, she became one with the
    ocean and embraced the corruption of her form. All magical transformations and
    curses that plague both people and creatures in the seas can be attributed to
    the Witch of the Depths.
  - "The biggest shark of the ocean is fused into a pirate ship. Its flesh is disintegrating
    and it\u2019s fired through cannons, causing destruction and pestilence. Once
    a legendary beast, it is now in great pain, screaming and twisting in a berserk
    rage."
  - A species thought extinct millions of years ago was alive in the depths of the
    ocean and had terrorised its inhabitants for ages, creating a cycle of violence
    that impacted all marine creatures.
